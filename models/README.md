## Database Models

TThese models are tailored to interact with the audit_logs table in different development environments and programming languages, ensuring broad compatibility and robust application architecture.

✖️ Creating models for the `audit_logs` table in various popular frameworks will ensure that you can interact with the data across different applications and services seamlessly. Here, I'll provide models for Laravel (PHP) and SQLAlchemy (Python), along with models for Django (Python), Rails (Ruby), Hibernate (Java), Entity Framework (C#), and Sequelize (Node.js).

1. [Laravel Model](./AuditLog.php)
2. [SQLAlchemy Model](./audit_log.py)
3. [Django Model](./models.py)
4. [Rails Model](./audit_log.rb)
5. [Hibernate Model](./AuditLog.java)
6. [Entity Framework Model](./AuditLog.cs)
7. [Sequelize Model](./audit_log.js)
